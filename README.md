# Smart_buy-project_on_electronic_store-
This project focuses on the aspect of an electronic vendor database. Customers can buy products by registering and logging in to their accounts. They can see the list of products displayed once the user logs in. It’s the customer’s decision on what where and how many to purchase. Once the order is placed, the customer is billed monthly to their account number. The project removes the products once purchased from the inventory. Employees can login to use the system from an admin point of view and perform tasks of a store employee like reports on inventory, customer activity, inventory list and quantities, storage capacity from data stored in the tables. Types of data needed to keep track of in this system will be the information, inventory control, and customer information and registration. Products information are critical to an online electronic store. Data about products which need to be incorporated into the design include: ID, brand, description, price. This fictitious Electronic store has multiple stores. Each store will have a record in the ‘store’ entity including a unique ID and address. Inventory will have a store ID component and products information. This will allow an admin to see the list of products in the store, the quantity, and the value of each product in the store inventory.
